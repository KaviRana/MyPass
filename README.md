Password Manager Program using Graphical User Interface.
This is called MyPass which will store and generate passwords.
The user will enter the name of the website , email id or username for that website and the password corresponding to the account
Then the user can either enter a password or have the program generate one password.
After the password is generated the user will add this new detail and a pop up will ask the user if its all okay.
On a YES click, the data gets added to a text file which is stored locally.

When the user wants to access any of the passwords required.They will use a search functionality.
